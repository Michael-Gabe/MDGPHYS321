# MDGPHYS321
Here are the finalized projects our group completed in Professor Craig Copi's class, Advanced Computational Physics (PHYS 321). All third-year students, the three group members were Tyler Kovach, Andrew Gaikema, and myself (Michael Gabe).

Generally, our group was free to choose the topic for each of our projects as long as they fit certain requirements. For project 1, we needed to solve a boundary value problem. Project 2, we had three topics to choose from, and we chose solitons. Project 3, our shortest project, required we use a Monte Carlo method. Project 4, our final project, required that we use 4-dimensional arrays.

Project 4 isn't a completed project, however, our group made good progress. While our group received help from Professor Copi throughout the semester, for Project 4, Professor Harsh Mathur gave our group the idea to model coffee spills and gave us help via email if we got especially stuck.
